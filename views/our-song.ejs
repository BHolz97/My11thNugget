    <h1>Our Song</h1>

<!-- <p>This is a special page that I would like to dedicate to a project that we can build together. We have always joked about writing a song together, and that gave me an idea. </p>
<p>Every song is made up of a whole lot of different elements, put together one at a time - from a beat to a chord progression, melody, lyrics, etc. </p>
<p>Each song is also made up of different parts - intro, verse, chorus, etc.</p>
<p>Every month on the 27th, starting from January, we are going to use this website to create one element of a song. I will upload a whole lot of options for a certain element of the song, and you can either pick one, or give me some kind of feedback.</p>
<p>At the end of the year, we will have effectively written a song together - you and I, from across the globe.</p> -->

<p> Welcome to Month 3! Things are startin gto take shape.</p>

<!-- <p> As I mentioned last time: </p>

<p>The thing with songwriting is that there are no rules, and there are so many ways that you can approach it. Although that is often a good thing, it does make planning this whole project a little tricky.</p>

<p>And so, I have tried to plan this out in such a way that it will leave room for us to change our mind about our approach if we would like, and also it will fit in with the way that I normally write songs. </p>

<p>The process will look roughly like this:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Chord progressions</li>
  <li>Style </li>
  <li>Melody</li>
  <li>Beat</li>
</ul>

<p>And from there, we can find our way once we have a better idea of what the song will sound like </p>

<p>Finally we will finish off with lyrics.</p> -->

<p>Last month we started to decide what kind of style we would be looking for in our song.</p> 

<p>This month, we will take it a little further as far as production is concerned, and start to add a but if a beat. </p>

<p>At this point we are still in the very early stages and things can still change quite a lot, but this is a good place to start. </p>

<p>From here on out, things are going to start getting interesting as we start to look at melodies and we start fleshing out other pieces of the song. </p>

<p>Always remember that if you have an idea for something different or something that you would like to add/take away, just let me know!</p>

<p><b>Today we're looking at step 3: Beat</b></p>

<p>You picked two options progressions last time, and so I worked with both and tried them on some different instruments and picked my favourites. There are only 3 options this month because I am pretty slow when it comes to beats and stuff so this took pretty long. But when we start to work with melodies then we will probably be back to having a load of options to choose from, because I really enoy that :) Obviously these are really rough - just to pick a sort of direction, and we can go from there. I also think that option 3 might work quite well without too much of a beat at all - at least in the verse. Maybe just some light tambourine or hi-hat stuff, but not a full on beat. So maybe think about that and let me know as well. Let me know which one you like, or if you like a combo of more than one, or if you have any ideas of your own!</p>
