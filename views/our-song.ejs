    <h1>Our Song</h1>

<p>This is a special page that I would like to dedicate to a project that we can build together. We have always joked about writing a song together, and that gave me an idea. </p>
<p>Every song is made up of a whole lot of different elements, put together one at a time - from a beat to a chord progression, melody, lyrics, etc. </p>
<p>Each song is also made up of different parts - intro, verse, chorus, etc.</p>
<p>Every month on the 27th, starting from January, we are going to use this website to create one element of a song. I will upload a whole lot of options for a certain element of the song, and you can either pick one, or give me some kind of feedback.</p>
<p>At the end of the year, we will have effectively written a song together - you and I, from across the globe.</p>
