    <h1>Our Song</h1>

<!-- <p>This is a special page that I would like to dedicate to a project that we can build together. We have always joked about writing a song together, and that gave me an idea. </p>
<p>Every song is made up of a whole lot of different elements, put together one at a time - from a beat to a chord progression, melody, lyrics, etc. </p>
<p>Each song is also made up of different parts - intro, verse, chorus, etc.</p>
<p>Every month on the 27th, starting from January, we are going to use this website to create one element of a song. I will upload a whole lot of options for a certain element of the song, and you can either pick one, or give me some kind of feedback.</p>
<p>At the end of the year, we will have effectively written a song together - you and I, from across the globe.</p> -->

<p> Today we will take the first steps in our 12 month project - to write a song together.</p>

<p>The thing with songwriting is that there are no rules, and there are so many ways that you can approach it. Although that is often a good thing, it does make planning this whole project a little tricky.</p>

<p>And so, I have tried to plan this out in such a way that it will leave room for us to change our mind about our approach if we would like, and also it will fit in with the way that I normally write songs. </p>

<p>The process will look roughly like this:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Chord progressions</li>
  <li>Style </li>
  <li>Melody</li>
  <li>Beat</li>
</ul>

<p>And from there, we can find our way once we have a better idea of what the song will sound like </p>

<p>Finally we will finish off with lyrics.</p>

<p><b>To start with:</b></p>

<p>We will pick a chord progression for the verse. Take a listen on the link below and let me know your thoughts. Some are simple, some are a little more flashy. NOTE: I have recorded all of these on a piano. That does not mean that they have to land up sounding like this in the end. Next month, we will pick the style of the song eg slow piano, more pop, more synth, etc. (once we have a chord progression to work with, picking a style is easier). But for now, take a listen and let me know which one jumps out at you. This is just a first step, so no matter what we choose, the door will still be wide open!</p>
