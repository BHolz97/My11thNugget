    <h1>Our Song</h1>

<!-- <p>This is a special page that I would like to dedicate to a project that we can build together. We have always joked about writing a song together, and that gave me an idea. </p>
<p>Every song is made up of a whole lot of different elements, put together one at a time - from a beat to a chord progression, melody, lyrics, etc. </p>
<p>Each song is also made up of different parts - intro, verse, chorus, etc.</p>
<p>Every month on the 27th, starting from January, we are going to use this website to create one element of a song. I will upload a whole lot of options for a certain element of the song, and you can either pick one, or give me some kind of feedback.</p>
<p>At the end of the year, we will have effectively written a song together - you and I, from across the globe.</p> -->

<p> Month 4 - Finally staring to sound like a song!</p>

<!-- <p> As I mentioned last time: </p>

<p>The thing with songwriting is that there are no rules, and there are so many ways that you can approach it. Although that is often a good thing, it does make planning this whole project a little tricky.</p>

<p>And so, I have tried to plan this out in such a way that it will leave room for us to change our mind about our approach if we would like, and also it will fit in with the way that I normally write songs. </p>

<p>The process will look roughly like this:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Chord progressions</li>
  <li>Style </li>
  <li>Melody</li>
  <li>Beat</li>
</ul>

<p>And from there, we can find our way once we have a better idea of what the song will sound like </p>

<p>Finally we will finish off with lyrics.</p> -->

<p>Alright - last month we found a decent beat. We've come a long way - we have a style, a chord progression and a beat now.</p> 

<p><b>This month, we're going to start working on a melody for our verse.</b></p>

<p>Normally, when I write a melody, I just kind of hum the melody over the recording and maybe sing some gibberish. Tbh, nobody dserves to have to listen to that haha. </p>

<p>So - I resorted to my second favourite technique and one which is very common, which is to write the melody with a piano.</p>

<p>From here it's a little easier to hear which melody is best without getting caught up in lyrics - which come later.</p>

<p>I made 3 options. Don't get weirded out at how strange it sounds with the piano playing the melody - this will be a person eventually. Song writing isn't always pretty, but if it works, it works haha.</p>

<p>Try to listen with earphones - I'm quite happy with how the mix is coming along :)</p>
